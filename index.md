Hi

I am a Budding Scientist at <strong> Conduent Labs</strong> (formerly known as Xerox Research Centre India). My research focuses on various aspects of machine learning, particularly in the domains of text analysis, time-series forecasting, deep-learning and distributed platforms. 

I received my bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation) with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from <strong> Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</strong> in 2017. During that period, I was also a visiting researcher at <strong>Duke University</strong> and an intern at <strong>TCS Innovation Labs</strong>. When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, dancing and taking short trips outside the city!
