<i> “ Most of human and animal learning is unsupervised learning. If intelligence was a cake, unsupervised learning would be the cake, supervised learning would be the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake. We know how to make the icing and the cherry, but we don’t know how to make the cake. We need to solve the unsupervised learning problem before we can even think of getting to true AI. ” </i>

My first encounter to the frontiers of AI came about during my internship at <strong>Duke University</strong> while working on Sentiment Analysis. Returning with a conviction to explore the field, I enrolled in the requisite coursework at <strong>IIT Kharagpur</strong> to strengthen my basics. Also, I started working on a project on Named Entity Recognition on Biomedical Text and hence, began my journey.

I followed it up by interning at <strong>TCS Innovation Lab</strong> India, and some further coursework in the subsequent semesters which included the domains of Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Intelligent Systems and High Performance Parallel Computing. 

Equipped with the right armoury, I set my foot in a research lab at <strong>Conduent India</strong>. Here, I was engaged with problems in Big Data Analytics Platform Architecture, Time-series Forcasting and Hate-speech Detection.

More than a year's experience in the industry has helped me in treading the crucial bridge between core research and its application. Hence, the immense opportunities provided by the AI revolution to impact people's lives has propelled me further to contribute my bit.
