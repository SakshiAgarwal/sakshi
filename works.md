We all are aware of the applications of Artificial Intelligence and it's importance of unfolding the hidden meaning in data associated with various aspects of the world. I was first introduced to this concept when I was associated at Duke University with Humans and Autonomy Lab during the summers of 2015. Discussions, talks I attended and the project I was involved in with the lab motivated me to explore the domain and get a deeper understanding. After my return, I was determined to participate in different coursework to strengthen my basics and work also on the experimentation side. After approaching one of my professors, I was given the task of named entity recognition on biomedical text. On further reading and implementations, I further interned at TCS Innovation Labs in text classification and regularization problems. There were many naive questions in my mind and so to solve them, I took up courses like Information Retrieval, Intelligent Systems, High Performance Parallel Computing and of course, Machine Learning. These courses enlightened me about various big data handling techniques, information retrieval algorithms and knowledge representations. 

Motivated to implement my ideas, I set foot on to a research lab (Conduent Labs India) where I was given a set of problems to tackle including Big Data Analytics platform architectures, forecasting in time-series and detect hate speech in online conversations. As one by one the difficulties in our problems unveiled, we looked into solutions delivering requirements along with research in the areas. In a research conducive environment, the teams helped me plan and execute and henceforth, shaped my career goals.
