We all are aware of the applications of Artificial Intelligence and it's important applications in various fields; it's remarkable potential to unfold hidden meaning in data gathered across the world.

My first introduction to the frontiers of AI came about during my internship at Duke University where I worked on Sentiment Analysis. Returning with a conviction to explore the field, I enrolled myself in the requisite coursework to strengthen the basics. I started with a project on Named Entity Recognition on Biomedical Text and there was no looking back.

I followed it up by an internship at TCS Innovation Labs and advanced coursework in the subsequent semesters which included Information Retrieval, Intelligent Systems, High Performance Parallel Computing and Machine Learning. 

Equipped with the right armoury, I set my foot in a research lab at Conduent India. Here, I tackled problems in Big Data Analytics Platform Architecture, Time-series Forcasting and Hate-speech Detection. More than a year's experience in the industry has helped me in treading the bridge between core research and its application.

The immense opportunities of the AI revolution has propelled me to be part of it.
