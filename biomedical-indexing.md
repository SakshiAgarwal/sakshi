I worked on a model for indexing keywords for Biomedical Articles as part of my undergraduate thesis in the Department of Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur. 

Under the guidance of [Professor Sudeshna Sarkar](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sudeshna/), I successfully completed the tagging of abstract biomedical articles. Capturing the semantics of the abstract and using the representations for indexing was our major focus. You can refer to the [report](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/BTPReport.pdf) for a detailed approach and experimentation. This was the first time I worked with Biomedical texts and was surprised how well RNNs captured the semantic relations in Biomedical text!
