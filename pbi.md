<strong>Police Business Intelligence</strong> is an operational crime analytics platform. This platform is designed to identify key crime performance indicators and caters to the needs of optimizing police resources and allocation at various cities. You can have a quick overview of the project [here](http://indialabs.conduent.com/innovation-story-detail-page/Operational%20Analytics%20for%20Police%20Business%20Intelligence).

There are many aspects to this platform. The ones I worked on are listed below : 

1. Building models for forecasting crimes like murder, rape etc on a day-to-day basis using <strong>Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process (RMTPP) </strong>. On a very specific note, we solve the problem of forecasting in cities with low crime data available with time. 

   This work has been submitted at <strong>[SIAM International Conference on Data Mining](https://www.siam.org/Conferences/CM/Main/sdm19)</strong> (SDM) and we are awaiting results.

2. Hosting the operational analytics on the Azure Cloud supporting distributed operational analytics for a better user experience.

3. Conceptualised a <strong>decision support framework</strong> for a big data analytics platform so as to make design choices automated for constumers. My work was presented at <strong>IEEE World Congress On Services</strong>.
