I contributed in integrating an existing commercial drone(Iris), an infrared camera, and a tablet controller. The team, guided by [Prof. Mary Cummings](https://pratt.duke.edu/faculty/missy-cummings) worked on an open-source application, called [Tower](https://github.com/DroidPlanner/Tower), which was used to send waypoints to the Iris drone. We further simplified the user interface and ensured that anybody could control the drone without much training. This application was used to monitor the wildlife preserves at a forest in Gabon, Africa at night. 

After modification of the tower application, the app :
1. Featured the camera feed real-time,
2. The functionalty of drone ready-to-take-off, take off and land buttons were made the same instead of confusing the user with three different icons.

The thermal camera (shown below) was integrated with the application to video the wildlife.

The feed while testing captured is shown below. The image shows a subject standing on the sidewalk surrounded by trees
