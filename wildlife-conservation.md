I worked on integrating an existing commercial drone(Iris), an infrared camera, and a tablet controller at <strong>Duke University</strong>. The team, guided by [Prof. Mary Cummings](https://pratt.duke.edu/faculty/missy-cummings) worked on an open-source application, called [Tower](https://github.com/DroidPlanner/Tower), which was used to send waypoints to the Iris drone. We further simplified the user interface and ensured that anybody could control the drone without much training. This application was used to monitor the wildlife reserves at night in a forest in Gabon, Africa. 

After modification of the tower application (refer to Figure 3), the app featured :
1. The camera feed real-time, integrating the thermal camera (Figure 1). Several feed of the camera was recorded during testing. Figure 2 shown below depicts a subject standing on the sidewalk surrounded by trees.
2. The functionalty of drone ready-to-take-off, take off and land buttons were made the same instead of confusing the user with three different icons.
3. Allowing the user to manipulate the drone while it is hovering.
