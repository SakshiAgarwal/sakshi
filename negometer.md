I worked in formulating and putting together pieces of a nascent project, Negometer aimed to evaluate and display in meter scale the fact of how negative a parent was being in front of his/her children in everyday life. Analysing the sentiments of the speech of a parent was done in the following way - separating the audio from the speech, analysing the noise signals along with detecting sentiments in the text converted from speech. 

The features were then aggregated for a classification task. I focused on sentiments of text via scoring each sentence as a negative,  positive or neutral comments via Support Vector Machines. As a beginner, this was an inspiration to start my exploration. Looking back, I now see various other methods being used to solve this problems as compared to our rudimentary approach.
