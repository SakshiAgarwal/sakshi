Negometer aims to evaluate how negative a person is in his/her daily life. Application of sentiment analysis through machine learning algorithms is the primary focus with collaborating the audio and the text attribute together

Override the default color scheme by setting `mdl_colors` in `_config.yml` to a supported Material Design Lite scheme (e.g. indigo-pink, deep_orange-blue).  Color schemes can be overridden on a single page by setting `mdl_colors` in the front matter. Use the [MDL theme builder](https://getmdl.io/customize/index.html) to find color schemes.

This page has `mdl_colors` set to `deep_orange-blue`.
