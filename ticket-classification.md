I worked on building a <strong>ticket classification</strong> module during my internship at [Tata Consultancy Service (TCS) Innovation Labs, India](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation). This module was to be used internally by the company to automate the process of assigning a particular complaint ticket as a software, hardware or e-mail issue. This module was to be added to a pre-existing online interaction system.   

During the internship period, after achieving the baseline results, a commom problem of overfitting in deep learning models (RNNs in our case) was solved. Significant performance increase (12% relatively) was recorded by implementing a proposed method of de-correlating hidden unit representations.
