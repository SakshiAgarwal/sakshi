As an active member of the [Robotics Community](https://2018.robotix.in/), I was involved in promoting and engaging students in robotics. Our team of dedicated students organised events and hands-on sessions at pan-India level.   

1. As a fresher, I participated in several workshops and events. 
2. I co-mentored two workshops for freshers in my second year. You could refer to the day-wise documentation of the students about what they learnt in their reports ([Phase 1 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-1.pdf) and [Phase 2 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-2.pdf)).
3. We conducted robotics events in the year of 2015 for our tech fest. To attract a number of participants, we also prototyped a bot in accordance with the event rules and created video tutorials.
4. Worked on an autonomous quadrotor in the research group [Aerial Robotics Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/) in my third year of under-graduation.
