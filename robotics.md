As an active member of the [Robotics Community](https://2018.robotix.in/), I was involved in promoting and engaging students in robotics. Our team of dedicated students organised events and hands-on sessions at pan-India level.   

1. As a fresher, I participated in several workshops and events. 
2. I co-mentored two workshops for freshers in my second year. You could refer to the day-wise documentation of the students about what they learnt in their reports ([Phase 1 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-1.pdf) and [Phase 2 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-2.pdf)).
3. We conducted robotics events and competitions for our tech fest in 2015. We prototyped bots and created video tutorials for the convinience of participants to increase the footfall.
4. Worked on an autonomous quadrotor in the research group [Aerial Robotics Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/) in my third year of under-graduation.
