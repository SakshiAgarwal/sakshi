As an active member of the [Robotics Community](https://2018.robotix.in/), I was involved in promoting and engaging students in robotics. Our team of dedicated students organised events and hands-on sessions at pan-India level.   

1. As a fresher, I participated in several workshops and events. 
2. I co-mentored two workshops for freshers in my second year. You could refer to the day-wise documentation of the students about what they learnt in their reports ([Phase 1 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-1.pdf) and [Phase 2 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-2.pdf)).
3. We conducted robotics events and competitions for our tech fest in 2015. We prototyped bots and created video tutorials for the convinience of participants to increase the footfall.
4. As a member of the research group, [Aerial Robotics Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/) we worked on an autonomous quadrotor.
