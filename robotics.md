As an active member of the Robotics Community, I was involved in promoting and engaging students of campus in robotics. Our team of dedicated students organised events and hands-on sessions.   

1. I participated in several workshops and events in robotics in my first year. 
2. Co-mentored two workshops for freshers in my second year of undergraduation - you could refer to the day-wise documentation of the students about what they learnt in their reports ([Phase 1 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-1.pdf) and [Phase 2 Workshop](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-2.pdf)).
3. Conducted robotics events in the year of 2015 for our tech fest. To attract a number of participants, we also prototyped a bot in accordance with the event rules and created video tutorials.
4. Worked on an autonomous quadrotor in the research group [Aerial Robotics Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/) in my third year of under-graduation.
