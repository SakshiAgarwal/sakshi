Other Interests
In my spare time, I work as a committee member in a conference namely, [Grace Hopper Celebration India](https://ghcindia.anitab.org/) (GHCI).

During my undergraduation, I was an active member in the English Dramatics Club. Once in a while, I also enjoy dancing and trekking.

A sneak peak!
