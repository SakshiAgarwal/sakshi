The recent spread of toxicity, hatred and abuse on social media, inspired us to detect and flag hateful comments. Odium Revelio! is an ongoing project at Conduent Labs designed to detect hate speech. The model not only focuses on flagging overt hate speech comments but also the subtle ones. For example :

As a researcher on the text analytics team, I am exploring and implementing attention based deep learning models in the application of subtle hate speech detection. We are also focusing on feature engineering aggregating the title, previous comments and external information from online sources such as, wikepedia and urban dictionary.
