The recent spread of toxicity, hatred and abuse on social media, inspired us to detect and flag hateful comments. <strong>Odium Revelio!</strong> is an ongoing project at <strong>Conduent Labs</strong> designed to detect hate speech. The model not only focuses on flagging overt hate speech comments but also the subtle ones. 

For example :

As a researcher on the text analytics team, I am exploring and implementing <strong>attention based deep learning models</strong> in the application of subtle hate speech detection. We are also focusing on <strong>feature engineering</strong> aggregating the title, previous comments and external information from online sources such as, wikepedia and urban dictionary.
