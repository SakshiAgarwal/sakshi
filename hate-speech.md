Motivated by the recent spread of toxicity, hatred and abuse on social media, we are inspired to detect these subtle or ambiguous hateful comments and flag them. Odium Revelio! is an ongoing work at Conduent Labs designed to detect hate speech in online conversations of an article. This model not only focuses on flagging overt hate speech comments but also subtle ones. For example :

As a researcher on the text analytics team, I am exploring and implementing attention based deep learning models in the application of subtle hate speech detection. We also focus on feature engineering aggregating the title, previous comments and external information from wikepedia and urban dictionary.
